Ecommify is an installation profile built for Drupal based off of The Ever So Awesome Drupal Commerce (http://drupal.org/project/commerce). Ecommify is mainly intended to be a pretty theme for Commerce. It was not intended to bring new ground-breaking functionality to Drupal Commerce. Matter of fact if you are looking something that will do that, we would recommend Commerce Kickstart (http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart).

Ecommify Was built by Louisville Web Group (http://www.louisvillewebgroup.com) for the general use of the Drupal Community. If you would like a custom solution or any other E-commerce solution feel free to contact us. (http://www.louisvillewebgroup.com/contact-us).

Thank you we hope you enjoy Ecommify.
